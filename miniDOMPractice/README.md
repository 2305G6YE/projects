# Overview :
This project was a overall summary and refresher on DOM Manipulation after watching the supplemental information provided from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events). I had three relatively simply tasks I had to program.
* A button that changes the background color of the page
* A textbox that outputs text live as input is sent.
* A incrementer program that can increase/decrease.


## Takeaways:
New inputs learnt: `parseInt()` `Math.round`  
Most used: `id` `document.querySelector` `variable.addEventListener`

Its helpful to implement a tiny bit of previously learnt topics here and there like flexbox and general css. I do not need to dive deep into revision, because while doing projects it seems to naturally need me to look up the relevant information and refresh along the way. I think I learnt not to worry too much about not remembering all the information I recently read in one go. More useful if I comprehend the information first.

ときどきに日本語を使うともっといい結果を表すだと思います。今日のプロジェクトに条件を満たし、追加する機能を含みました。

For example, i added these additional functionalities:
* A clear button in the 2nd segment if the user wishes to clear their previously inputted text.
* A reset button in the 3rd segment if the user wishes to start from the value of 0.
* A hidden functionality in the 3rd segment that makes the number text in segment 3 invisible until the incrementer process has begun, or if resetted, invisible until the user decides to start the process again.

## Going Forward

I would like to slowly add more css and html elements that I previously learnt in snippets here and there in future projects. It seems like an efficient way to revise and in a way, tie parts of my learning journey together. 
I also want to continuously, but not exhaustively use different ways of representing the same inputs. Some on the top of my wishlist to include in the future are:
* `switch`
* `for.. in` 
* `flex: {} {} {}`
* `map``filter``reduce`
