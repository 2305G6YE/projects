# Overview
<p> The point of this project was to shadow <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i37KVt_IcXw&list=PLillGF-RfqbYE6Ik_EuXA2iZFcE082B3s&index=4&ab_channel=TraversyMedia">Travesy Media's DOM Crash Course series videos</a> in creating a simple item listing project that can add, delete, and remove items. The code was taken from his description, I followed along by manually typing the javascript as I watched the video. All credits to the code go to him.</p>

## Takeaways
It is always very different shadowing a person rather than just watching the video. From the start I had to solve a few technical issues on my own. For example, the `head` section of the code was not provided to me, and I never had any experience using Bootstrap templates in my code. In self-reading about bootstrap and referencing it differently from the video, I also inadvertently learnt a small new keyboard shortcut on auto converting code to comments.

This 'feeling' of picking up snippets here and there is probably what coders have been talking about. The 'pick up as you code' feeling.
