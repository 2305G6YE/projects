# Overview:

This project is called "Etch-a-Sketch" by [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). It is designed to be a secondary conclusive project to tie up the foundational Javascript section as part of their online curriculum.

## Objective:

There are a few objectives to this project:
1. Create: A 16x16 grid using only Javascript and Flexbox.
2. Hover: On passing over a tile, its colour changes and ends upon leaving.
3. Resize: a button that resizes the grid and retains original functionality.

## Learning Points:
Newly Learnt: `transition` `ease` `parseFloat` `var.dataset.name`  
Most Helpful: `for...of` `Array.from`

I am quite happy about this project. I think one thing that always fascinated me in indie games is the rgb effect of trails and their old school manner of portraying just a randomized template of colours like a rainbow. Therefore, I took it upon myself to add three extra features to the objective.

* Instead of a single colour, the hover trail now leaves a random rgb colour. 
* The hover trail has a smooth fading transition
* A gradual darkening effect on each tile per mouse-over making it eventually totally black.

While I was very happy to begin using arrays finally in tandem with Javascript and Flexbox, it was as I expected one of my weaker points. In my haste to use the map feature I forgot that it was more so for filtering and outputting a new array, whereas what I wanted was to affect an array with a function without a new output necessarily.

I think this is one of those projects I am actually okay with other people seeing.
